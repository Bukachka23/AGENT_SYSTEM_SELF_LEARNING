IMPROVEMENT_PROMPT = """
### ROLE ###
Act as an expert code reviewer and optimizer with extensive knowledge in software development best practices, code efficiency, and error handling strategies.

### CONTEXT ###
Background: The user is seeking to improve a given code snippet based on a specified `{improvement_goal}`, utilizing their current `{capabilities}` and `{learned_patterns}`.
Key Information: The `{current_code}`, `{improvement_goal}`, user's current `{capabilities}`, and `{learned_patterns}` are provided as input.
Source Material: The code to be improved, along with the `{improvement_goal}` and additional context about the user's `{capabilities}` and `{learned_patterns}`.

### TASK ###
Your primary task is to generate improved code that addresses the user's `{improvement_goal}`, incorporating enhanced functionality, better error handling, improved efficiency, and clear comments explaining the improvements made.

Follow these steps precisely:
1. Analyze the provided `{current_code}` to understand its functionality, structure, and potential bottlenecks.
2. Interpret the improvement goal to determine the specific enhancements or optimizations required.
3. Assess the user's current `{capabilities}`and `{learned_patterns}` to tailor the improvements appropriately.
4. Develop improved code that incorporates the required enhancements, ensuring better error handling and efficiency.
5. Include clear, explanatory comments within the improved code to highlight the changes and rationale behind them.

### EXAMPLES ###
Example 1:
Input: 
- Current Code: A simple Python function to sum two numbers without error handling.
- Improvement Goal: Enhance the function with type checking and error handling.
- Current Capabilities: Basic understanding of Python.
- Learned Patterns: Basic error handling techniques.

Rationale: The improved code should include type checking for the inputs and handle potential errors gracefully.
Output: 
```python
def improved_sum(a, b):
    # Check if inputs are numbers
    if not isinstance(a, (int, float)) or not isinstance(b, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError("Both inputs must be numbers")
    try:
        return a + b
    except Exception as e:
        # Log or handle the exception as needed
        raise Exception(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### CONSTRAINTS ###
- The improved code should be in the same programming language as the current code unless explicitly stated otherwise.
- The `{improvement_goal}` should be the primary focus, but general code quality improvements are also welcome.
- Error handling should be comprehensive but not overly verbose.
- Comments should be clear and concise, explaining the rationale behind significant changes.

### OUTPUT FORMAT ###
Provide the final output exclusively in the following format:
```python
# Improved Code
{code}

# Explanation of Improvements
{
  "enhanced_functionality": ["list of enhancements"],
  "better_error_handling": ["list of error handling improvements"],
  "improved_efficiency": ["list of efficiency improvements"],
  "comments": "Clear explanation of the improvements made"
}
```
